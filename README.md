### Running the development projects

To run both the `web` and `bot` projects at the same time, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

> **Note**: You don't need to run both projects always at the same time, they can work separately

## Creating your own bot instance

You will need your own bot to run the project locally, it is also recommended to create a new Discord server as a testing playground.

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click on New Application
2. In the General Information page, copy the `APPLICATION ID`, this is the value of the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` env var
3. Go to the Bot page, click on Reset Token. Copy the new token and store it in the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` env var. **DO NOT** share this token anywhere
4. In the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section, enable `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT` and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`

To invite the bot to your own server, go to the OAuth2 > URL Generator page, select the `bot` scope and add the following permissions:

- Manage Roles
- Send Messages
- Send Messages in Threads
- Manage Message
- Manage Threads
- Embed Links
- Read Message History
- Add Reactions
- Use Slash Commands

Copy the Generated URL and open it in your browser

### Registering Discord commands

To use the context and slash commands you first need to register them in Discord. The easiest way to do that is by running this command:

```sh
pnpm dev:register-commands
```

Notice the `dev:` prefix in the command. Discord limits how many times you can register commands with their API, but by registering the command in a specific server you can do this as many times as you want. You need the `DEV_GUILD_ID` env var set to use this command

## Creating the database

This project uses PlanetScale as the DB provider, you can create a free account at https://planetscale.com. To create the database, follow these steps:

1. Create a new database in your dashboard
2. Click on the "Get connection strings" button
3. Add a name to this password and set the Role to `Read/write`
4. Click on Create Password, the next screen should give you the `DATABASE_URL` env var to be copied to the `.env` file of both `web` and `bot` projects

### Running migrations

To run migrations you need a password with the `Admin` role, follow the previous steps to create one. Add the generated database URL to the `packages/db/.env` file and run this command:

```sh
pnpm migrate
```
